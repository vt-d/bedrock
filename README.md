# Bedrock

Bedrock is a highly scalable open source general purpose Discord bot meant to replace MEE6.

## Components

### Stratum

`stratum` is the foundational data ingestion layer for Bedrock. It is responsible for connecting to Discord's real-time gateway and forwarding events to the rest of the system.

It is written in Rust and uses the [`twilight`](https://twilight.rs/) library, a powerful and flexible set of tools for interacting with the Discord API. `stratum` creates multiple connections (shards) to Discord to handle events from many servers at once. Events are then published into a NATS JetStream for other components to consume, creating a resilient and scalable event-driven architecture.
